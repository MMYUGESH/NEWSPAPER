                <p>Samsung Galaxy A52 5G smartphone was launched on 17th March 2021. The phone comes with a 6.50-inch
                    touchscreen display with a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels and an aspect ratio of 20:9. Samsung
                <p> Galaxy A52 5G is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor that features 2
                    cores clocked at 2.2GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.8GHz. It comes with 6GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy
                    A52 5G runs Android 11 and is powered by a 4500mAh battery.
                <p>
                    The Samsung Newsroom site shows that the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is bundled with a 15W charger despite
                    the fact that it has 25W fast charging support.
                <p>Samsung's Australia site also indicates that the 4G
                    version of the Galaxy A52 isn't bundled with a 25W charger. The Samsung Galaxy A72, however, comes
                    with a 25W fast charger

                        Apple may bring Mini-LED displays to its MacBook Air by 2022 and the iPad Air models from the
                        same year will come with OLED displays. The development was reportedly shared by analyst
                        Ming-Chi Kuo in a research note. There have been reports in the past suggesting Apple will soon
                        launch its Mini-LED display powered MacBook and iPad Pro models, and it seems like these
                        displays will be exclusive to iPad Pro models when it comes to tablets.

                    <p> The rupee pared some of its initial gains to settle two paise higher against the US dollar on
                        Thursday, March 18, at 72.53, tracking subdued domestic market sentiment and a stronger dollar
                        overseas. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the domestic unit opened stronger at 72.48
                        against the dollar but could not hold on to gains, amid a massive selloff in the domestic equity
                        markets. During the trading session, the local unit witnessed an intra-day high of 72.43 and a
                        low
                        of 72.60. In an early trade session, the rupee appreciated nine paise to 72.46 against the
                        greenback. On Wednesday, March 17, the rupee had settled at 72.55 against the American currency.

                    <p> Fans on whose demand this 'Snyder cut' has come into being will have no reason not to feel that
                        justice has been done to them, that the disappointment of 2017's Justice League, which Zack
                        Snyder had to bail out of owing to a family tragedy, has been wiped away. The film's punishing
                        length, which less enthusiastic viewers will definitely find rather avoidable, will only
                        probably add to their delight.</p>
