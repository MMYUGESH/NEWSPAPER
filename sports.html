                <p>Former India cricketer Suresh Raina, who had missed the Indian Premier League 2020, is "super
                    excited" about joining the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) squad ahead of this year's tournament.
                <p>
                    Raina had missed the 13th edition of the cash-rich league after pulling out of the
                    tournament due to personal reasons. The star batsman has been a key player for CSK and in
                    his absence, the team had a dismal outing in last year's IPL. The Chennai-based franchise
                    finished seventh in the IPL points table but with Raina set to return to the fold, CSK will
                    be looking to get back to winning ways in IPL 2021.</p>

                    Former Indian cricketer Parthiv Patel feels with Ruturaj Gaikwad doing well in the domestic circuit
                    and Suresh Raina coming back in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) squad, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led
                    side will be raring to go in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The
                    Chennai-based franchise had a dismal outing in last year's IPL. The side finished at the seventh
                    position on the points table. Raina had missed the IPL 2020 season after pulling out of the
                    tournament due to personal reasons but will play in this year's league.
                <p>He (MS Dhoni) had an indifferent season last year but as we saw how keen he is (spoke to him few
                    times) and he is very determined to get CSK's ball rolling to start with," Parthiv added.

                    CSK have won the IPL thrice and are regarded as one of the most successful franchises in T20
                    history.
